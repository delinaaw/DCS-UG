    <p class="about-text" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #bdbaba;">
        This is the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer Science. 
        The study of computer science is therefore critical if society is to take full advantage of the 
        benefits Information Technology has to offer and make rapid economic advances. Computer science 
        involves the study and development of applications that allow for our everyday use of computers, 
        the software systems that support these applications, and the means and methods used to produce 
        both applications and systems that behave reliably, correctly and ethically. At the heart of 
        Computer Science lies the skill of computer programming and employers who hire Computer Scientists 
        expect adept programmers with knowledge of current techniques and tools and the ability to apply 
        sound engineering principles to the development, construction and maintenance of computer programs. <br><br>

        The range of courses available in the department and the skills acquired by students enable them to 
        find employment in many diverse fields of the economy and prepare our graduates for the computing 
        industry, working in a project team (or research and development team), and to enable the graduate 
        to bring specialist skills to that team. The course also provides the platform for further study or 
        research through exposure to established and emerging technologies and methods, and to active fields 
        of research in Computer Science. <br><br>
        
        The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science 
        -Major (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor (3:2:2:1) as well as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.</p>
